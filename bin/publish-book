# Prepares a version of the book suitable for publication on swift.org.
#
# To use top-of-tree DocC, clone the following repositories:
#
#     https://github.com/apple/swift-docc
#     https://github.com/apple/swift-docc-render
#
# Then set environment variables to paths in their working directories,
# like the following, before running this script:
#
#     DOCC_EXEC=~/git/DocC/.build/arm64-apple-macosx/debug/docc
#     DOCC_HTML_DIR=~/git/DocC-Renderer/dist/

set -eu

# Pretty print DocC JSON output, so that it has a stable ordering and
# can be diffed.  This lets us determine whether rebuilding resulted in
# any changes to the content.
export DOCC_JSON_PRETTYPRINT="YES"

# The published version of the book gets the swift.org header.
