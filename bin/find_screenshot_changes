# This script helps identify changes that show up in screenshots.
#
# Set $COMMIT to the oldest commit this script should consider:
# ideally, that's the commit when the current screenshots were taken.
#
# Lines in the output that start with whitespace are unchanged since $COMMIT.
# Lines that start with a commit ID were changed in that commit, after $COMMIT.
#
# To check whether we need to re-shoot the screenshots,
# run this script and check whether any lines start with commit IDs.
# For example:
#
#     ./bin/find_screenshot_changes.zsh | grep -v '^ '
#
# To show those commits that made scheenshot changes:
#
#     ./bin/find_screenshot_changes.zsh |
#     cut -d ' ' -f 1 |
#     sort -u |
#     xargs -L1 git --no-pager log -1
